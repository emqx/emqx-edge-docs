# Get Started 

## Overview 

*EMQ X Edge* is an open source, lightweight MQTT broker running at any resource constraint edge devices. It's written in Erlang/OTP, and Erlang/OTP is a concurrent, fault-tolerant, soft-realtime and distributed programming platform. MQTT is an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol powering IoT, M2M and Mobile applications. 

Highlights of the *EMQ X Edge Broker* : 

  * It supports MQTT, TCP, WebSocket and different industry protocols such ModBus. 
  * It can be running at different kinds of resource constrained edge devices, such as Raspberry Pi, gateway and industrial servers. 
  * It provides local data processing and cloud synchronization which will automatically synchronize data with cloud service based on network status. 
  * Integrated with EMQ X Storm which provides central monitoring and management services.

## Features 

  * Lightweight - 20MB runtime memory with minimal resource consumption, which can run on ARM/x86 CPU, from Raspberry Pi to industrial X86 servers. 
  * Near real-time response - processing the data generated locally, so it can respond quickly to local events. 
  * Operate online or offline - it operate locally and can cache data when network is not available; when theyâ€™re back online it can synchronize data to the cloud and use the cloud for management, analysis and date persistence. 
  * Easy management & monitoring - central edge broker management, data synchronization, visualized monitoring tools based on web UI. 
  * Extensibility - Open APIs available to third party plugins to support more protocols, new functions and features. 



## Quick Start 

### Download and Install 

The *EMQ X Edge* is cross-platform, which could be deployed on Raspberry Pi, Linux and FreeBSD. 

Download binary package from: [ https://emqx.io/downloads ](https://emqx.io/downloads) . 

Installing on Linux, for example: 
```bash
unzip emqx-edge-centos7-v3.1.zip && cd emqx

# Check Status
./bin/emqx_ctl status
    
# Stop EMQ X
./bin/emqx stop
```

### Installing from Source 

::: tip Tip
The *EMQ X Edge* broker requires Erlang/OTP R21+ to build since 3.0 release.

cd emqx && make rel
    
cd rel/emqx && ./bin/emqx console
```

## Plugins 

The *EMQ X Edge* broker could be extended by Plugins. A plugin is an Erlang application that adds extra feature to the *EMQ X Edge* broker:
